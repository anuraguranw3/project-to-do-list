## üìã Project Overview
This is an advanced **To-Do App** built with React and Redux, featuring:
- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
- **Priority-Based Sorting**: Assign priorities (High, Medium, Low) to tasks and visually differentiate them.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetch and display real-time weather data for any city.
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout functionality to protect the To-Do list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks and user authentication state are saved to `localStorage` for persistence across page reloads.
